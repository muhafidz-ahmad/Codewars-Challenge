# Task
You're given a year n (1583 <= n < 10000). You need to create a function which return True if n is a leap year and False otherwise.

# Restrictions
Your code mustn't contain:
- def
- if
- eval or exec
- return
- import

# Note
Feel free to rate the kata when you finish it :)

P.S.: Sofisticated cheats, which do not circumvent the testing framework itself, are welcome.
